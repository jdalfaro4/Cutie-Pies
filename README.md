# Cutie-Pies

## Description

This web app is intended to display the capabilities of everything short of the transaction property of an online sale! This was inspired by a previous pie saleswoman located in Texas. She had a passion for selling pies but lacked an internet point of sales. This web app was designed to fullfill her needs. This website will allow you to select between your favorite and most delectible pie flavors, add them to the cart for checkout, and grant you a total for shipping. You will also be able to learn about the company history and review direct contact information for any feedback you wish to submit.

This project proved most challenging as there were so many aspects to actually submitting each commit and branch push when working with a team. It was important to keep your submissions in order and making sure our branches were up to date as needed. 

API's are still new to us so this was another obstacle we had to face but when teamed up with some brilliant people, we accomplished our goals. The CSS gave us a whole new branch of issues that seeing as how we couldn't use our comfort API of bootstrap, but as described before, as a team, we were able to succeed. This web page will bring you in and make you feel at home, but most of all you will feel the odd feeling of needing a slice of pie.
